# Bean-There-Rated-that
Welcome to *Bean There, Rated That* – a simple coffee rating log for students who live off caffeine but can’t remember if that last iced mocha was actually good or not. This Python-based project helps you track and rate your favorite (or regrettable) coffee drinks so future you doesn’t suffer through the same bad choices again.

## Project Description

This is a small, personal Python app that lets you:
- Log your coffee drinks by name, location, and rating (1–10).
- Write a quick review for each drink (optional).
- Browse past drinks and see which ones you’ve loved (or hated).
- Avoid buying that same overpriced disaster again.

Perfect for students who are always on the move, love coffee, and want to keep their wallet and taste buds happy.

## Why We Built This

As college students, coffee is our fuel — but we often forget if a drink we tried before was actually worth it. Instead of guessing each time, we thought, why not build a quick app to help us remember? Plus, it’s a fun excuse to practice Python file handling, user input, and basic data structures.

## Features

- Command line interface (CLI)
- Add new coffee logs
- View all past logs
- Sort drinks by rating
- Prevent duplicates (optional)

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- File I/O (`.txt` storage – no database required)
- CLI-based interaction

## How It Works

1. Start the app (`python coffeelog.py`)
2. Choose from:
   - Log a new drink
   - View past ratings
   - Exit
3. Coffee info is saved to a `.txt` file
4. Rinse. Repeat. (Just like your French press)
